## Our Goal

A weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-).

This weather app allows you grab the weather condition of your current location with the use of asynchronous programming in Dart.
It enables us carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.
You can also get the weather condition of any city in the world you can think of.
